## About

The project is a free and open source game built using SDL and OpenGL which allows it to be ported
    to many platforms; you can [download a package](https://redeclipse.net/download) for Windows
    and GNU/Linux; or grab a development copy from our [Git repository](https://redeclipse.net/devel)
    and live on the bleeding edge.

In a true open source by the people for the people nature, we try to work closely with the gaming
    and open source communities to provide a better overall experience, aiming to create a game
    environment that is fun and easy to play, while still having elements to master.

If you think you might have something to contribute to the game or community, please feel free to
    drop by our [Discord server](https://redeclipse.net/chat) or [forums](https://redeclipse.net/forums)
    and talk to us directly. We try to maintain a standard of friendly behaviour in our community,
    so don't be afraid to speak up and have your say in building this game for us all!

For creators, the full power of a highly expanded [Tesseract](http://tesseract.gg/) engine is at
    your fingertips in the included realtime easy-to-use WYSIWYG editor that is capable of creating
    maps both offline and online with other people in cooperative edit mode.

## Distribution

This game is primarily distributed via Steam. For the most bleeding-edge version of the game, or
    for those who are unable to get a Steam account, it is possible to compile the game from
    source, following the [Install Guide](https://www.redeclipse.net/docs/Install-Guide).

## Get Involved

You're encouraged to help the project by joining in with the rest of the community to make a better
    project! You can do this by participating in our Community, using the development version and
    reporting any issues, ideas, suggestions or comments you may have.

Our main method of community interaction is via the [Discord server](https://redeclipse.net/chat).
    Here, you can talk directly to the Red Eclipse developers, contributors, and supporters;
    whether you just want to have a chat, report a problem, or make a suggestion, this is the best
    place to do it.

## Open Source

The project is Free and Open Source, meaning that you can both use it for free and be a part of it
    by contributing in whatever way you can. These are the people who have helped shape Red Eclipse
    into what you see today. They are regular people just like you who volunteer their time or
    donate in the spirit of making a really cool game. Your name could be down here, too!
