## About
Red Eclipse is a fun-filled new take on the first-person arena shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself towards a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety of environments.

The project is a free and open source game built on the Cube Engine 2 using SDL and OpenGL which allows it to be ported to many platforms; you can download a package for Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, and MacOS X; or grab a development copy from our Git repository and live on the bleeding edge.
