## About
Red Eclipse is a fun-filled new take on the first-person arena shooter, built using the technology found in [Tesseract](http://tesseract.gg/), which lends itself towards a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety of environments. For more information, visit our [Wiki](https://redeclipse.net/wiki) or [Forums](https://redeclipse.net/forum).

The project is a free and open source game built using SDL and OpenGL which allows it to be ported to many platforms; you can [download a package](https://redeclipse.net/download) for Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, and macOS; or grab a development copy from our [Git repository](https://redeclipse.net/devel) and live on the bleeding edge.


In a true open source by the people for the people nature, we try to work closely with the gaming and open source communities to provide a better overall experience, aiming to create a game environment that is fun and easy to play, while still having elements to master.

If you think you might have something to contribute to the game or community, please feel free to drop by our [IRC chatroom](https://redeclipse.net/chat) or [forums](https://redeclipse.net/forums) and talk to us directly. We try to maintain a standard of friendly behaviour in our community, so don't be afraid to speak up and have your say in building this game for us all! :)
