About
=====
Red Eclipse is a fun-filled new take on the casual first person arena shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself toward a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety of environments. For more information, please see our Wiki or Forum.

The project is a Free and Open Source game, built on Cube Engine 2 using SDL and OpenGL which allows it to be ported to many platforms; you can download a package for Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X; or grab a development copy from our Subversion repository and live on the bleeding edge.
