// a brush has two parts: the brushmap and the brushhandle

// the brushmap is a 2D field that defines how the brush affects a heightmap

// the brushhandle is a 2D vertex on the brushmap.
// this handle is a reference point on the brushmap which represents
// where the editing cursor is pointed at.
