## GUIDELINES FOR CONNECTING TO THE RED ECLIPSE MASTER SERVER

The Red Eclipse Team provides the play.redeclipse.net master server for the
benefit of the Red Eclipse community. We impose a general set of guidelines for
any server/user which connects to the play.redeclipse.net master server. The Red
Eclipse Team reserves the right to block any attempt to connect to the master
server at their discretion. Access to services provided by the project are
considered to be a privilege, not a right.

These guidelines are imposed to ensure the integrity of both the Red Eclipse
game and the surrounding community. If you do not agree to these terms, you
should not connect to the play.redeclipse.net master server, or any servers
which are connected to it. These guidelines are not designed to limit your
opinions or freedoms granted to you by the open source licenses employed by the
project, nor do they cover usage of the game in either offline play or on
servers which are not connected to the Red Eclipse master. If you do not agree
to these terms you are still able to run the game without the use of the master
server.

If you have questions or comments regarding these guidelines please contact the
Red Eclipse Team. Any person seeking to modify their game or server for use on
the master server should first seek permission from the Red Eclipse Team, each
modification must be approved and will be done on a case-by-case basis. It is
advised you create a topic in the "General Discussion" section of the official
Red Eclipse discussions located at https://redeclipse.net/discuss

NOTE: By playing online you consent to the disclosure of certain information for
legitimate administration and moderation purposes. This includes, but is not
limited to: Username, Steam ID and handle, Discord handle, IP address, Hardware
configuration, and Operating system details.

### Guidelines for Servers

(See RE Mark Policy for definitions of "substantially (un)modified")

* The gameplay of the server must not grant an unfavorable advantage or
  disservice to any party.
  - "Humans vs Zombies" is fine, as long as it rotates roles in a fair manner.
  - Giving one player double the health of other players permanently is not
    permitted.
  - Game variables may not be set in such a way that makes it impossible to
    avoid harming yourself or teammates (i.e. no suicide weapons).

* If the gameplay of the server is modified substantially this must be indicated
  clearly, preferably using the "serverdesc" and "servermotd" variables.
  - If you wish to disable one or more weapons on the server, use the
    "sv_<weapon>disabled" variable. Letting players wield a weapon, but changing
    variables so that weapon doesn't actually work (such as by setting its
    damage output to 0) is not allowed.

* If the source code of the server is modified substantially you must contact
  the Red Eclipse Team to check that the changes are permitted by creating a
  a topic in the official Red Eclipse discussion area at https://redeclipse.net/discuss

* The server must honour the master server system, allowing global bans and
  granting the correct access by the Red Eclipse Team, or moderators assigned by
  them.
  - Red Eclipse has a global authority system in place which is enforced for all
    servers that wish to be listed on the official master server to ensure the
    integrity of the project and surrounding community.

* The server must not advertise or otherwise spam messages excessively.
  - Sending periodic messages regarding announcements, events, or sponsors
    is fine, so long as the messages aren't intrusive and sent more than once
    every three minutes.

* The server must not have a name that is offensive or send any messages that
  could be interpreted as offensive.
  - Offensive language covers things such as bigotry (racist, religious, or
    sexually derogatory [gender or orientation] remarks)

* The owner of a server may outline their own rules, specific to their server.
  - These rules may not revoke any part of this document.
  - These rules must not make any unreasonable or illegal demands.

* Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the immediate ban and
  removal of the server in question from listing on the master server, without
  warning.

### Guidelines for Users

* Players must behave in a manner that is not disruptive to the game.
  - Cussing is fine, so long as it doesn't involve bigotry (racist, religious,
    or sexually derogatory [gender or orientation] remarks), unless a server is
    designated as "family friendly" and provides a clear definition of what
    kind of language is not permitted.
  - Intentionally killing team mates or scoring for an opposing team is not
    permitted. This includes "kamikaze" tactics that result in negative scores.
  - Cheating, flooding and/or spamming is not permitted. This includes sending
    too many messages via in-game communication over a short amount of time.

* The owner of a server may outline their own rules, specific to their server.
  - Players on a server with additional rules must follow said rules unless the
    demands are unreasonable, illegal, or revoke part of this document.
  - If any part of the rules supplied by a server violate this document, then
    all rules supplied by the server are considered to be null and void.

* Failure to adhere to follow these guidelines or a request by a moderator to
  follow them can result in an immediate mute, quarantine, kick, and/or ban,
  without warning, possibly from the Red Eclipse master server and all servers
  listed on it.
  - It is important to note that moderators are considered to be representatives
    of the Red Eclipse community and should be treated with respect when
    performing their official duties.
  - This does not include personal interactions with moderators outside the
    scope of the rules outlined in this document.
  - Moderators are not obliged to disclose any information or provide an
    explanation regarding any disciplinary actions.

* Players may not circumvent any disciplinary action taken against them.
  - This includes changing IP addresses to avoid the use of mute, quarantine,
    kick and/or ban applied either locally or globally by the Red Eclipse master
    server.

* If a player or moderator believes that the behaviour of any moderator is not
  supported by this document, it is advised that they lodge an official
  complaint in the "General Discussion" section of the official Red Eclipse
  discussions located at https://redeclipse.net/discuss
  - Arguing or being otherwise antagonistic about official moderator decisions
    via in-game communication is not allowed.
  - Attempting to mislead or otherwise deceive in a complaint is grounds for
    disciplinary action and may result in an immediate closing of the complaint.
  - Lodging a complaint does not guarantee that action will be taken.
  - The Red Eclipse Team is not obliged to disclose to the complainant what
    actions have or have not been taken.

### Guidelines for Moderators

* Moderators must act in a fair and impartial manner, employing the "warn, then
  kick, then ban" approach, unless there is an emergency or immediate need.
  - It is important to remember moderators are considered to be official
    representatives of the Red Eclipse community and they should approach each
    situation in a professional manner.
  - Extended verbal disputes with players in-game is not permitted and
    moderators are encouraged to ignore abuse from other players.
  - The powers of a moderator should be not be used for personal disputes with
    another player or moderator.

* The use of mute, quarantine, kick, and/or ban should only be used when a user
  violates sections of this document. If in doubt, moderators should seek the
  advice of their peers (other players and/or moderators) before proceeding
  with disciplinary action.
  - A moderator may mute, quarantine, kick, and/or ban for other reasons
    provided there is a sufficient reason that is causing a severe detriment.
  - A moderator may not use mute, quarantine, kick, and/or ban as a way to
    silence a player who is simply being offensive or otherwise acting in a way
    that the moderator finds undesirable without violating this document.
  - Personal opinions are not an enforcable reason for disciplinary action and
    moderators should not assume they are always right.

* Moderators should try to maintain a unified front when it comes to decision
  making in-game. If one moderator disagrees with the actions taken by another
  moderator it is advised that they discuss the situation before taking any
  further action.
  - If there are multiple moderators online, they may opt work together to come
    to a concensus by a majority vote regarding whether to take further action.
    Any moderators who do not vote or remain silent are said to abstain.
  - Further action includes undoing any disciplinary actions that have been
    carried out already. Moderator in-fighting is unprofessional behaviour.
  - If a resolution can not be found then efforts should be made to find a more
    senior member of the Red Eclipse Team to mediate the dispute.
  - Mediation methods may include an open topic in the "General Discussion"
    section of the official Red Eclipse discussions located at
    https://redeclipse.net/discuss for the community to weigh in on and generate
    a better concensus on the topic.

* If a moderator believes that any player behaviour not covered by this
  document should result in disciplinary action, they should create a topic in
  the "General Discussion" section of the official Red Eclipse discussions
  located at https://redeclipse.net/discuss
  - Moderators should remember that it is important to maintain a professional
    attitude when dealing with other players and arguing or being otherwise
    antagonistic outside of executing disciplinary actions is not advised.
  - Attempting to mislead or otherwise deceive in a report is grounds for
    disciplinary action and may result in an immediate closing of the report.

* Failure by a moderator to follow or uphold the rules may result in their
  access being immediately restricted or revoked, without warning.
  - The Red Eclipse Team is not obliged to disclose what actions have or have
    not been taken.
