Comment:
 I, Martin Erik Werner ("arand") have had a longer email discussion with Ed
 Merrit (the Author of Akashi) regarding the license of the Akashi font
 available from Ten By Twenty, and the conclusion is that the Akashi font is
 distibuted under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) 1.1
 Copyright © 2007 - 2013 Ten by Twenty.

 Hi Martin,
 I've updated the footer of the site to state that all fonts are
 distributed under the SIL Open Font License.

 Hi Ed,
 .
 (I was using the alias "Arand Nash" with the ienorand@gmail.com email
 previously. I've since switched over to using the birth name)
 .
 We are currently using your typeface "Akashi" for several pieces of
 "word art" and in the logo of the Free and Open Source FPS game Red
 Eclipse <https://redeclipse.net>.
 .
 It's an awesome font which we really like! :)
 .
 I previously contacted you regarding a clarification of the font
 license, since we tend to be a bit picky with our licenses in order to
 remain fully open source, the clarification I got at that point we
 deemed fine.
 .
 However, it seems that some distributions, into which we would very much
 like Red Eclipse to be accepted, wants a more formal license for things
 (explicitly allowing use, modification, and redistribution with or
 without modification).
 .
 (The discussion in question is on a bug report for the game package in
 the linux distribution Fedora:
 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=895947)
 .
 Would it be possible to get a more formal clarification of the license
 for the Akashi font covering those bits, or more preferably, would it be
 possible to use the Akashi font under a well-known license like the
 OFL-1.1, since this would make sure to avoid all the misinterpretation
 pitfalls of a custom-written license.
 .
 Thanks!

 SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 .
 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

     arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
     or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
     including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
     work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
     a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work
     in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
     Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
     encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
     or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
     below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
     constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
     entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
     each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
     together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the
     purposes of this License.
  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
     of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer
     of ownership.
  d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer
     (s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
     individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
     individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)
     in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
     other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
     otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
     (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
     entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
     broadcast.
  f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
     this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
     scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
     expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
     dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
     in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
     cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
     analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
     sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are
     assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work
     of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional
     work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent
     it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety
     or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
     or artistic work.
  g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
     the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
     exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
     communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
     process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
     performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
     members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
     individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means
     or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the
     Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast
     the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
  i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
     limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
     reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
     performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
 or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
 exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
     label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
     original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
     work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
     indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
     Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
         the rights granted under this License;
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
         the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
         licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
         to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License; and,
     iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
         royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
         member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
         schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
         granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
     this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
     the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
     When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
     effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
     Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
     Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
     this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
     required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
     notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
     the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4
     (a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
     to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
     Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
     Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
     reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
     Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
     URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
     Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an
     Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
     (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
     Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
     however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
     credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a
     manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
     authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
     by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
     or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
     endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
     appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties.
  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
     derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
     Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
     jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
     Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
     deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
     Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
     fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
     make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
     upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
     entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
     License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
     individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
     under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
     License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
     under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
     force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
     Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
     and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
     to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
     remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
     parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
     extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
     by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
     or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
     shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
     communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
     written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
     the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
     1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
     WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
     take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
     sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
     If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
     intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

License: CC-BY-SA-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
     including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
     work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
     a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work
     in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
     Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
     encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,

     constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
     entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
     each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
     together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the
     purposes of this License.
  c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
     http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
     Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
     including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have
     the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this
     License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of
     works made available under that license under this License or a Creative
     Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this

     other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
     otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
     (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal

     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
     broadcast.
  h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
     this License including without limitation any production in the literary,

     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
     dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
     in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
     cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
     analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
     sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are
     assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work
     of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional

     or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
     or artistic work.
  i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
     the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
     exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
  j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
     communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or

     members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
     individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means
     or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the

 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
 or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
 exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
     label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
     original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
     work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
     indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
     Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
         the rights granted under this License;
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
         the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
         licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
         to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License; and,
     iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
         royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
         member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
         schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
         granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
     this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
     the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
     When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
     effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
     Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
     Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
     this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
     required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
     notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
     the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
     of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
     License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
     license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
     License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
     (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
     under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
     of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
     the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
     you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
     following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the
     Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the
     Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
     of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep
     intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
     disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
     Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
     applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
     not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made
     subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4
     (a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
     to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
     Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
     Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
     reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
     Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
     URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
     Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
     Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
     (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
     Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
     however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
     credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a
     manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
     authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
     by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
     or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
     endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
     appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties.
  d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
     derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
     Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
     jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
     Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
     deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
     Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
     fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
     make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
     upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
     entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
     License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
     individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
     under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
     License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
     under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
     force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
     Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
     and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
     to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
     remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
     parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
     extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
     by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
     or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
     shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
     communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
     written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
     the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
     1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
     WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
     take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
     sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
     If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
     intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
     wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
      respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
      for the public:

 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public

      Rights.
 .
   e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright

      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
 .
   j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights

      available to the public including in ways that members of the
      public may access the material from a place and at a time
      individually chosen by them.
 .
   l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 .
   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .

 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
   a. License grant.
 .
        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part; and
 .
             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
           its terms and conditions.
 .
        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
           6(a).
 .
        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
        5. Downstream recipients.
 .
             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.
 .
             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.
 .
        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
           Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
           Public License.
 .
        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .

 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
           form), You must:
 .
             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:
 .
                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                     Material and any others designated to receive
                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                     designated);
 .
                 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                     warranties;
 .
                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                     extent reasonably practicable;
 .
             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
           information.
 .
        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
           reasonably practicable.
 .
   b. ShareAlike.
 .
      In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
      Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
        1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
           license with the same License Elements, this version or
           later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
 .
        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
           Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
           context in which You Share Adapted Material.
 .
        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
           or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
           Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
           rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .

 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
 .
      including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .

 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .

 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
           violation; or
 .
        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .

 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .

 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

 of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including,
 without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications
 to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements,
 understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material. For
 the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not form part of the
 public licenses.

License: CC0-1.0
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
 of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
 works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
 and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
 These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
 culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
 works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
 part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
 is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
 terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
 Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;
  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;
  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
      in a Work;
  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
      directive); and
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
      implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
 Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
 of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
 future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
 medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
 including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
 purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
 member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
 successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
 revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
 equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
 as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
 be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
 Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
 account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
 extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
 person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
 irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
 maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
 time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
 of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
 limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
 "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
 applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
 partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
 of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
 will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
 Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
 action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
     the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
     the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
     Work.
  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
     this CC0 or use of the Work.

License: Mark-Policy
 THE RED ECLIPSE MARK POLICY
 .
 .
   General Guidelines
 .
 The purpose of the Red Eclipse mark policy is to encourage the widespread use
 of Red Eclipse marks by the community while controlling the use of the marks in
 order to avoid confusion on the part of software users and the general public,
 to maintain the value of the image and reputation of the marks and to protect
 them from inappropriate or unauthorized use.
 .
 Any use of any Red Eclipse mark must be in accordance with this policy. Any use
 that does not comply with our trademark policy is not authorized.
 .
 Marks cover the following items: The name "Red Eclipse", the Red Eclipse emblem
 (without text) and the Red Eclipse logo (with word art text).
 .
 Do not assume that this policy will answer every question about the use of Red
 Eclipse marks, if in doubt, contact the Red Eclipse project.
 .
 .
   Permitted Use
 .
 You may use the marks without prior written permission (subject to the
 following terms):
 .
 1. To refer to the Red Eclipse software in substantially unmodified form.
 .
   "Substantially unmodified" for source code means built from the source code
   provided by The Red Eclipse project, possibly with minor modifications
   including but not limited to: the enabling or disabling of certain features
   bydefault, translations into other languages, changes required for
   compatibility with a particular operating system distribution, the inclusion
   of bug-fix patches, or the bundling of additional extensions.
 .
   "Substantially unmodified" for gameplay and art means using the game data
   provided by The Red Eclipse project, possibly with minor modifications, for
   example including additional maps, artwork, and sounds. The gameplay and art
   needs to closely resemble that of Red Eclipse in it's unmodified form, and
   not create an unfair advantage in gameplay.
 .
   Example: You may modify Red Eclipse to start in windowed mode by default, but
            if you set the gravity in the game to zero, this counts as a
            substantial modification.
 .
   Example: You may modify the laser beams to be green instead of purple, but if
            you change all the weapon models into fresh fruits, this counts as a
            substantial modification.
 .
 2. To identify Red Eclipse as a distinct component of a software offering.
 .
 3. To factually refer to The Red Eclipse project itself, its products, or its
    protocols.
 .
    Example: You may use "Bob's Add-ons for Red Eclipse" or
             "Bob's forum for Red Eclipse" but not "Bob's Red Eclipse".
 .
 4. When referring to Red Eclipse that is not substantially unmodified, to say
    that such software is a "derivative of" or "based on" Red Eclipse. You may
    use the marks as part of the name of a product designed to work with Red
    Eclipse, so long as the name as a whole (via its other components) clearly
    and unambiguously distinguishes the product from Red Eclipse, and the
    general presentation of the product does not imply any official association
    or identity with the Red Eclipse project.
 .
 .
   Non Permitted Use
 .
 You may not use the marks in the following ways:
 .
 1. In any way likely to cause confusion as to the identity of the Red Eclipse
    project, the origin of its software, or the software's license.
 .
 2. In any way that indicates a greater degree of association between you and
    Red Eclipse project than actually exists.
 .
 3. In any way that implies a designated successor to Red Eclipse
    (e.g., "Red Eclipse++" is not permitted).
 .
 4. In any way that indicates that the Red Eclipse project favours one
    distribution, platform, product, etc. over another except where explicitly
    indicated in writing by the Read Eclipse project.
 .
 Thus uses of the marks in a domain name or company name without explicit
 written permission from the Red Eclipse project are prohibited.
 .
 .
   Other Legal Notes
 .
 The Red Eclipse project reserves the sole right to:
 .
 1. Determine compliance with this policy.
 .
 2. Modify this policy to preserve the rights of Red Eclipse, the public, the
    community, and the users.
    The latest version of the Red Eclipse Mark Policy should be available at
    <https://redeclipse.net/wiki/Trademark_Policy>
 .
 3. Grant exceptions to this policy, of any kind and for any reason whatsoever,
    other clauses notwithstanding.
 .
 .
   Other Use
 .
 If you have questions regarding the policy, or if any of the examples are
 unclear, feel free to contact the Red Eclipse project, for example via the
 Red Eclipse forums.
 .
 If you would like to use the Red Eclipse marks for any other use, please
 contact us and we'll discuss a way to make that happen. We don't have strong
 objections to people using the name for their websites and businesses, but we
 do need the chance to review such use.
 .
 In other words, it's not a big deal, and a short conversation (via the forums
 for example) should clear everything up in short order.
 .
 If you currently have a product that is using the Red Eclipse marks in a way
 that don't follow this policy, don't panic. Let us know, and we'll work it out,
 as described above.

License: Discord-Developer-TOS
 Discord Developer Terms of Service
 Effective Date: August 20, 2017
 https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal

If Discord makes available updated versions of the API or SDK, you will use reasonable efforts to use only the then-current version as soon as possible and will use only the then-current version within 30 days of the date the then-current version becomes available. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for providing user support and any other technical assistance for your Applications and other products and/or services.
 .
 2. LICENSE, ACCOUNTS AND RESTRICTIONS
 2.1 API or SDK License.

In doing so, you shall adhere to Discord’s brand guidelines, currently located at https://discordapp.com/branding. In addition, all use of the SDK must be in compliance with Discord’s in-game brand guidelines. All use by you of the Discord trademark (including any goodwill associated therewith) shall inure to the benefit of Discord. At no time during or after the term of this Agreement shall you challenge or assist others to challenge the Discord trademark or the registration thereof by Discord, nor shall you attempt to register the Discord trademark or brand identifiers (including domain names) that are confusingly similar in any way (including but not limited to, sound, appearance and spelling) to the Discord trademark. You shall include in your Applications, website and other relevant locations a disclaimer stating that your Applications, website or any services is or are not endorsed or created by Discord.
 2.4 End User Data. “End User Data” means all data associated with the content within the functionality enabled by the API or SDK, including but not limited to message content, message metadata, voice data and voice metadata. You acknowledge and agree that Discord and its end users, as applicable, retain all worldwide right, title and interest in and to the End User Data. If you have access to End User Data through the API or the SDK, you shall ensure that your Applications do not collect, use and/or disclose End User Data except (a) as necessary to exercise your rights under this Agreement, (b) in accordance with Discord’s Privacy Policy. If you have access to End User Data through the SDK, you additionally agree to get express permission from the End Users.
  - You shall not sell, license or otherwise commercialize any End User Data. You may not use End User Data to target End Users for marketing or advertising purposes. You may not disclose End User Data to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization related service.
  - You shall delete all End User Data upon Discord’s or the End User’s request and within seven (7) days following the End User’s termination of the End User’s account. You may only retain chat logs as necessary for the operation of your Applications. Discord’s offering of an API or SDK that allows you to reproduce or display End User message content is not an express or implied license to such content from Discord.
 2.5 End Users. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, you agree to the following with respect to End Users and their accounts:
 (a) You shall not modify an End User's account state except in response to such End User giving you explicit permission to do so. For example, you may not join an End User to a server unless such End User approved joining that server (such as when using a "group finder" app).
 (b) You shall not post messages, trigger notifications, or play audio on behalf of an End User except in response to such End User expressly opting-in to each instance of such behavior.
 (c) You shall ensure that your Application retains End User Data after the End User’s termination of the End User’s account only if the End User associated with such End User Data expressly triggers a command with an explicit keyword or click (on a website) and even in such cases, such End User Data shall be retained only as necessary to provide the defined functionality of the Application.
 (d) You shall ensure that an End User’s access to the Platform or any portion of functionality enabled by the SDK or API is subject to the TOS; accordingly, you shall ensure that all End Users expressly agree to the TOS. Without limiting the foregoing, you shall ensure that each End User expressly agree to the collection, use and disclosure of all information made available by such End User in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the TOS, which includes Discord’s Privacy Policy.
 (e) You and your Application will not, and you will not, encourage or create functionality for your users that violates Discord’s TOS.
 (f) You shall ensure that all End User Data is stored using reasonable security measures, including, but not limited to encryption, and that you take reasonable steps to secure End User Data.
 (g) You shall not obtain End User passwords to Discord’s service under any circumstance; you shall use only Discord’s designated approval methods for obtaining access to or permission to access End User Data.
 2.6 Developer Accounts. You will need to create an account to have access to the SDK and/or API (the “Developer Account”). In conjunction with your Developer Account, you will: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself, your Applications and your business (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You may be limited by the account creation process to one account per email address. You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and Developer Account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You will not share your Developer Account, your user name and password with any third party or permit any third party to log on using your account information. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Developer Account or any other breach of security of which you become aware. You agree that we can use, store, and share Registration Data as permitted in Discord’s Privacy Policy. Discord maintains the right to cancel your Developer Account for any reason or no reason at all, at any time. After you have successfully created your Developer Account, you will be issued one or more unique security keys, secrets, tokens, access codes, passwords or other credentials (collectively, “Keys”). All activities that occur using your Keys are your responsibility. You are not permitted to disclose, sell, transfer, or sublicense them to anyone.
 2.7 Rate Limits. You will not attempt to exceed or circumvent limitations on access to and use of the SDK or API, exceed or circumvent any limitation on the API calls you may make, or otherwise use the SDK or API in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume, or constitutes excessive or abusive usage (“Rate Limits”). If Discord, in its sole discretion, determines that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent Rate Limits, or other controls that limit use of the SDK or API, then your ability to use the SDK or API may be temporarily suspended or permanently blocked.
 2.8 Security Measures. Your network, operating system and the software of your web servers, databases, and computer systems must be properly configured to securely operate and store your Applications. Your Applications must use industry standard security measures to protect against and prevent security breaches and any unauthorized disclosure of the personal information of your End Users, including administrative, physical and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of the personal information of your End Users. You must promptly report any security deficiencies in, or intrusions to, your Applications or systems that you discover.
 2.9 Audit and Monitoring. You agree to provide us with access to your Applications and/or other materials related to your use of the API and SDK as may be requested by us to verify your compliance with this Agreement, to audit your use, display and storage of the API and SDK. You agree that we may crawl or otherwise remotely monitor such items related to your use of the API and SDK and you agree not to block or interfere with such efforts.
 .

 You acknowledge and agree that Discord may create features, applications, content, and other products or services that may be similar to your Applications, and nothing in this Agreement will be construed as restricting or preventing Discord from creating and fully exploiting such applications, content and other items, without any obligation to you. If you elect to provide us with any suggestions or feedback, you hereby assign all right, title and interest in and to such suggestions or feedback to Discord and acknowledge that we will be entitled to use, implement and exploit any such suggestions or feedback in any manner without restriction, and without any obligation of confidentiality, attribution, accounting or compensation to you.
 .
 5. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
 Except for the licenses expressly granted to you in this Agreement, Discord shall own and retain all right, title and interest, including without limitation all intellectual property rights, in and to (i) the API or SDK and any and all elements and components thereof, including content, technology, software code, user interfaces and any derivative works and/or compilations thereof; (ii) the Discord trademark; and (iii) any feedback provided by you (including suggestions, comments, improvements, ideas, etc.) about or relating to Discord, the API or SDK or any applications, websites or other materials that Discord may be developing (collectively, “Discord Property”). You shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to your Applications, except with respect to any Discord Property or End User Data that has been incorporated therein.
 .
 6. TERMINATION
 Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that we may have, Discord may terminate the license granted hereunder: (i) upon notice if Licensee fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; or (ii) for convenience, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice. In addition, Discord may terminate or suspend the license granted hereunder if your Application(s) for any reason compromise or threaten to compromise the integrity of Discord’s service. In the event the license is terminated, Licensee shall discontinue any further use, and destroy all copies, of the API or SDK and Documentation in its possession or control. Sections 1.2, 1.3, 4-9 and 11-16 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 .
 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL DISCORD OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES (COLLECTIVELY, THE "DISCORD PARTIES") BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF INFORMATION OR DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE API OR SDK OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY EVENT, THE DISCORD PARTIES’ TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AND TYPE (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT OR TORT) SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE LICENSE FEE (IF ANY) PAID BY YOU FOR THE API OR SDK OR (B) $100. THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS AGREEMENT DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, DISCORD’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. IT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT IN THE EVENT ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT.
 .

 .
 10. CONFIDENTIALITY
 You will: (a) protect and not disclose information made available by us that is identified as confidential or that reasonably should be considered confidential; (b) use this information only to fulfill your obligations under this Agreement; and (c) either destroy or return all such information to us promptly when the Agreement terminates (and, upon request, confirm such destruction in writing).
 .
 11. PUBLICITY

 .
 16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
 This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between Discord and you with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications with respect thereto. We may change this Agreement from time to time in our discretion. If we make a material change to the Agreement, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect.

 .
 17. GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION AND VENUE
 This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in all respects in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law.
